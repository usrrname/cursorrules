## 🔧 Optimization Techniques Applied

### 1. **Condensed Descriptions** (50-70% reduction)
**Before**: Verbose explanations of rule purposes
**After**: Concise, focused descriptions

### 2. **Reduced Examples** (60-80% reduction)
**Before**: Multiple verbose examples with full outputs
**After**: 1-2 essential examples with abbreviated outputs

### 3. **Simplified Rule Definitions** (40-60% reduction)
**Before**: Complex nested logic with verbose patterns
**After**: Modern JavaScript syntax with streamlined logic

### 4. **Removed Redundant Metadata** (70-80% reduction)
**Before**: Extensive metadata with author, created, updated, tags
**After**: Essential metadata only (priority, version)

### 5. **Consolidated Common Patterns** (30-50% reduction)
**Before**: Repetitive rule definitions
**After**: Shared components and references

## 📋 Documentation Examples Verified

All examples from the official documentation work correctly with the optimized rules:

### README.md Examples ✅
