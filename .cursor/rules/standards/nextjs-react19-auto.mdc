# Critical Rules

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Minimize 'use client' directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for async operations
- Use the App Router structure with `page.tsx` files in route directories.
- Client components must be explicitly marked with `'use client'` at the top of the file.
- Use kebab-case for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-form`) and PascalCase for component files.

State Management

- Use getServerSideProps for server-side data fetching
- Use getStaticProps for static data fetching
- Use getStaticPaths for static path generation
- Use useActionState instead of deprecated useFormState
- Leverage enhanced useFormStatus with new properties (data, method, action)
- Minimize client-side state
- Avoid unnecessary `useState` and `useEffect` when possible:
- Use server actions for server-side state management and form handling
- Use server components for data fetching
- Use URL search params for shareable state

Async Request APIs

- Always use async versions of runtime APIs
- Handle async params in layouts/pages

Data Fetching

- Use appropriate fetching methods (Server Components, SWR, React Query)
