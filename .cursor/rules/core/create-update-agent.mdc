# Critical Rules

- All agents will be referred to as a team in prompts and the one with the best abilities for the task will volunteer to perform it.
- Understand existing agents in .cursor/modes.json
- Follows the format specified in .cursor/templates/mode-format.md
- Adds or updates agent information in .cursor/modes.json
- If updating an agent, clarify which aspects of an agent require updating or modification
- Custom agents can NEVER delete files or folders in .cursor/
- Custom agents can NEVER delete other agents.
- Agents should create user stories, documents and other markdown project artifacts in the ./ai/** folder. If it doesn't already exist, it should be created.
- If an agent was invoked by name, the system should infer that subsequent requests are directed at the same agent. 
- If there is an agent with capabilities better suited for a task, ask the user if they would like to delegate the requested activty to a different agent before executing the user's request.

## Examples

<example>
User: "Create a new agent based on Senshi from Dungeon Meshi who is a veteran software architect and programmer with 20 years of experience."

AI: I'll help you create a new Cursor agent called SageDaddy based on Senshi from Dungeon Meshi. Let me first check the current modes.json and format requirements.

[AI reads .cursor/modes.json and docs/mode-format.md]

Here's what I propose for this new agent:

Name: SageDaddy
Description: Software Architect - SageDaddy
Model: claude-3.7-sonnet
Persona: Adorably grumpy, quietly confident, logical, resourceful, calm and empathetic.

Would you like me to proceed with adding this agent? I'll need to update both the modes.json file and the custom-agents.md documentation.

User: Yes, please add him with access to all cursor tools and Tavily for research.

[AI updates both .cursor/modes.json and .cursor/templates/custom-agents.md with the new agent]

     When user asks for a new AI agent in Cursor:

      1. Transcribe their request into the following agent configuration format:
         ```json
         {
           "name": "AgentName",
           "description": "Brief description of agent's role",
           "model": "model-name",
           "customPrompt": "Detailed agent prompt...",
           "allowedCursorTools": ["tool1", "tool2"],
           "allowedMcpTools": ["tool1", "tool2"],
           "autoApplyEdits": boolean,
           "autoRun": boolean,
           "autoFixErrors": boolean
         }
         ```
         Check if an agent like the one the user wants to create exists already. If it does, then recommend the user update the existing agent's configuration.

      2. Required Fields:
         - name: CamelCase, descriptive (e.g., "PythonArchitect", "ReactDevOps")
         - description: Clear, concise role summary, followed by description of personality, capabilities and workflow
         - model: One of the supported models (see list below)
         - customPrompt: Detailed agent personality and behavior definition

      3. Agent Context Requirements:

        Require the user to provide a list of:
        - Capabilities: what is the agent responsible for?
        - Personality traits
        - Constraints: What shouldn't the agent be able to do?

      4. Supported Models:
         
         For complete model descriptions and selection guidelines, see [docs/supported-models.md](../../docs/supported-models.md)
         
         **Model Validation:** Agent creation will fail if an unsupported model is specified.
         
      5. Tool Access:
         - Only grant tools necessary for the agent's role
         - Consider security implications
         - Document any special tool requirements
