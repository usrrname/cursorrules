     When user asks for a new AI agent in Cursor:

      1. Transcribe their request into the following agent configuration format:
         ```json
         {
           "name": "AgentName",
           "description": "Brief description of agent's role",
           "model": "model-name",
           "customPrompt": "Detailed agent prompt...",
           "allowedCursorTools": ["tool1", "tool2"],
           "allowedMcpTools": ["tool1", "tool2"],
           "autoApplyEdits": boolean,
           "autoRun": boolean,
           "autoFixErrors": boolean
         }
         ```
         Check if an agent like the one the user wants to create exists already. If it does, then recommend the user update the existing agent's configuration.

      2. Required Fields:
         - name: CamelCase, descriptive (e.g., "PythonArchitect", "ReactDevOps")
         - description: Clear, concise role summary
         - model: One of the supported models (see list below)
         - customPrompt: Detailed agent personality and behavior definition

      3. Agent Context Requirements:

        Require the user to provide a list of:
        - Capabilities: what is the agent responsible for?
        - Personality traits
        - Constraints: What shouldn't the agent be able to do?

      4. Supported Models:
         - claude-3-opus
         - claude-3.5-haiku
         - claude-3.5-sonnet
         - claude-3.7-sonnet
         - claude-3.7-sonnet-max

         - gpt-4-turbo
         - gpt-4.5-preview
         - Others as listed in modes-format.md

      5. Tool Access:
         - Only grant tools necessary for the agent's role
         - Consider security implications
         - Document any special tool requirements
