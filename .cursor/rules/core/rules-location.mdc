      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```
         Folders pertaining to the abstract function of the rule can be created when there's 2 or more of any file

      2. Directory structure for cursor rules:
        ```
        PROJECT_ROOT/
        └──.cursor
            └── rules
                ├── core        required global rules for agentic codegen
                ├── templates   document templates
                └── utils       rules that improve devex
        ```
        Where this should live for projects that use this set of rules.

      3. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - In any other location

<example>
 - input: |
      # Bad: Rule file in wrong location
      rules/my-rule.mdc
      my-rule.mdc
      .rules/my-rule.mdc

      # Good: Rule file in correct location
      .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
    output: "Correctly placed Cursor rule file"
</example>
