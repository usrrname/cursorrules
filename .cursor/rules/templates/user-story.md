## User Story Template for { PRD # }

Status: { ToDo | In Progress | Done }

This is a user story template that you can use to document user stories for your software development projects. User stories follow the "As a [role], I want [an action or feature], so that [a reason or benefit]" format, and they help define the functionality and requirements of a feature or improvement.

### How to Use:

1. Copy the template below:

```markdown
**As a [role],**
**I want [an action or feature],**
**So that [a reason or benefit].**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criteria 1: Describe the first acceptance criterion here.
- [ ] Criteria 2: Describe the second acceptance criterion here.
- [ ] Criteria 3: Describe additional criteria as needed.

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.
- [ ] Code is reviewed and approved.
- [ ] Necessary tests are written and pass.
- [ ] Documentation is updated, if applicable.

```

1. Customize the template by replacing [role], [an action or feature], [a reason or benefit], and the acceptance criteria with your specific project details. Be as clear and detailed as possible to accurately describe the user story.

2. Add any additional information or context that is relevant to your project or team.
