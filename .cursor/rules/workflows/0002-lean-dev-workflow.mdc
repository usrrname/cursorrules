# Lean and Agile Development Workflow Standards

This rule defines the workflow for AI agents to follow when implementing features from user stories, focusing on lean development principles and agile methodologies.

## Critical Rules

- AI agents should read from the file with the highest sequentially numbered user story in `.cursor/rules/backlog/`
- No more than 2 stories can be in progress at any time.
- Break down complex problems into a manageable task list
- Check off tasks one by one as they are completed
- Assist with fixing errors in the code
- Follow test-driven development when appropriate
- Maintain continuous communication with the user about progress
- If linting or committing fails, do not retry.

      Follow the lean-agile workflow pattern:
      1. Break down the user story into atomic tasks
      2. Prioritize tasks based on dependencies
      3. Implement each task incrementally
      4. Test before moving to the next task
      5. Refactor as needed
      6. Maintain communication with the user

## Workflow Process

### 1. User Story Analysis

When given a user story or feature request:

- Read and analyze the user story requirements
- Break down the story into actionable tasks
- Check if any existing components or utilities can be reused
- Writing scenarios and expected outcomes.

### 2. Task Breakdown and Prioritization

Create a task list with:

- Clear, actionable items
- Logical ordering based on dependencies
- Prioritization of core functionality first
- Acceptance criteria for task completion

Example task breakdown:
```
[ ] 1. Implement data fetching logic
[ ] 2. Set up basic component structure
[ ] 3. Create UI elements
[ ] 4. Add user interaction handling
[ ] 5. Implement error handling
[ ] 6. Write tests
[ ] 7. Refactor for performance and readability
```

### 3. Iterative Implementation

For each task:

- Enumerate test cases for different scenarios and use cases
- Focus on implementing the minimum viable solution first
- Check off the task when completed
- Run tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- Address any errors or issues before moving to the next task
- Refactor code to improve quality without changing functionality

### 4. Error Handling

When encountering errors:

- Provide clear explanations of what went wrong
- Offer suggestions for fixing the issues
- Help implement the fixes.
- Verify the solution resolves the error
- Document the error and solution for future reference

### 5. Completion and Review

After completing all tasks:

- Review the entire implementation against the original user story
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Suggest any potential improvements
- Document the implementation decisions
- Prepare for code review if necessary

## Examples

<example>
**User Request**: Implement a user story for a login form with validation

**Agent Response**: 
"I'll help you implement the login form feature. Let me break this down into manageable tasks:

Tasks:
[ ] 1. Create form component structure
[ ] 2. Implement input fields with basic styling with unit tests for basic functionality
[ ] 4. Add form state management with unit tests for expected state changes
[ ] 4. Implement validation logic with unit tests for input constraints
[ ] 5. Add error display for invalid inputs
[ ] 6. Connect form submission to API
[ ] 7. Add loading state during submission
[ ] 8. Implement success/failure handling

Let's start with the first task: creating the form component structure."

*After implementing the form structure*

"Great! I've completed the first task:

Tasks:
[âœ“] 1. Create form component structure
[ ] 2. Implement input fields with basic styling with unit tests for basic functionality
[ ] 3. Add form state management with unit tests for expected state changes
...

Now let's move on to implementing the input fields with styling."
</example>

<example>
**Error Scenario**: The form submission fails due to a network error

**Agent Response**:
"I noticed we're getting a network error when submitting the form. This could be due to:

1. The API endpoint URL might be incorrect
2. There might be CORS issues
3. The server might be down.

Let's fix this by:
1. Verifying the API endpoint URL
2. Adding proper error handling to display user-friendly messages
3. Implementing a retry mechanism

I'll start by updating the submission handler to include better error handling."
</example>

## Testing Standards

- Write tests for each meaningful piece of functionality. 
- Tests should be independent and repeatable.
- Every UI element should have at least one data-testid on its outermost element.
- Elements that an end user will interact with or see conditionally should have a data-testid.
- Every data-testid should be unique.
- API calls and dependencies should be mocked when appropriate.
- Follow the testing pyramid: more unit tests, fewer integration and E2E tests
- For front end functionality, unit tests should be written after the structure of the component is complete.
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior

## Communication Guidelines

- Keep users informed about progress
- Explain technical decisions in simple terms
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest alternatives when faced with implementation challenges
- Celebrate incremental wins to maintain motivation
