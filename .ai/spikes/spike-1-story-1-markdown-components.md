# Technical Spike: Rendering Components within Markdown/MDX in Astro

[link-to-user-story](../story-1.story.md)
[link-to-arch](../architecture/astro-blog-architecture.md)

## Investigation Goals
- [ ] Can standard markdown (`.md`) files in Astro import and render custom Astro/React/Vue/etc. components?
- [ ] Is MDX (`.mdx`) required for rendering components within markdown content in Astro?
- [ ] How is component usage syntax handled within markdown/MDX?
- [ ] How are component props passed from markdown/MDX?
- [ ] What are the setup requirements (dependencies, configuration) for this?

## Timeline
- Start Date: [YYYY-MM-DD] 
- End Date: [YYYY-MM-DD] 
- Time Box: ~1-2 hours

## Investigation Areas
1. **`.md` File Component Rendering**
   - Approach: Attempt to import and use a simple custom `.astro` component within a standard `.md` file.
   - Tools/Technologies: Astro, `.md` file, basic `.astro` component.
   - Success Criteria: Component renders correctly or Astro build provides clear error/guidance.

2. **`.mdx` File Component Rendering**
   - Approach: Install Astro MDX integration, attempt to import and use a simple custom `.astro` component within a `.mdx` file. Test passing props.
   - Tools/Technologies: Astro, `@astrojs/mdx` integration, `.mdx` file, basic `.astro` component.
   - Success Criteria: Component renders correctly with props within the `.mdx` file.

## Code Artifacts
- Repository: [Current Project]
- Branch: `spike/story-1-markdown-components` (to be created)
- Key Files:
  - `path/to/example.md`: Example standard markdown file.
  - `path/to/example.mdx`: Example MDX file.
  - `path/to/SimpleComponent.astro`: Simple component for testing.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Perform the investigation steps.
- [ ] Document findings.
- [ ] Make a recommendation based on findings.

## Team Impact
- Frontend: Dictates how content creators can use interactive elements within posts.
- Backend: Minimal impact, related to content structure.
- Infrastructure: Minimal impact, might involve adding MDX integration.
- Testing: Requires testing component rendering within content.
